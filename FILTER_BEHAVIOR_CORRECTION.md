# Filter Behavior Correction - COMPLETE

## 🐛 **ISSUE FOUND**

**Problem:** "Show Completed" checkbox was incorrectly showing ONLY completed items instead of ADDING completed items to the view.

**User's Feedback:** "When I click on the show completed it doesn't show me everything plus completed, it only shows completed which is incorrect behavior."

---

## ✅ **CORRECTED BEHAVIOR**

### **Original (Wrong) Logic**
```
Default: Show Pending + Missed
Show Completed ☑️: Show ONLY Redeemed  ❌ WRONG
```

### **New (Correct) Logic**
```
Default: Show Pending + Missed (hide Redeemed)
Show Completed ☑️: Show Pending + Missed + Redeemed (ALL items) ✅ CORRECT
```

## 📊 **COMPLETE FILTER BEHAVIOR TABLE**

| Checkbox State | Pending (NULL) | Redeemed (true) | Missed (false) | Description |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **None (Default)** | ✅ Show | ❌ Hide | ✅ Show | Incomplete work only |
| **Show Completed** ☑️ | ✅ Show | ✅ Show | ✅ Show | **ALL items** |
| **Hide Missed** ☑️ | ✅ Show | ❌ Hide | ❌ Hide | Only pending |
| **Both Checked** ☑️☑️ | ✅ Show | ✅ Show | ❌ Hide | Pending + Completed |

---

## 🎯 **USE CASES**

### **1. Default View (No Filters)**
```
Shows: Pending + Missed
Use Case: "Show me what needs to be done"
- See items awaiting decisions (Pending)
- See items that didn't happen (Missed)
- Hide completed work to reduce clutter
```

### **2. Show Completed Checked**
```
Shows: Pending + Missed + Redeemed (EVERYTHING)
Use Case: "Show me the complete picture"
- See all items regardless of status
- Review what's done alongside what's not done
- Useful for reporting or auditing
```

### **3. Hide Missed Checked**
```
Shows: Only Pending
Use Case: "Focus on items that need decisions"
- Only see items that haven't been decided yet
- Hide both completed and missed items
- Useful for working through a clean list
```

### **4. Both Filters Checked**
```
Shows: Pending + Redeemed
Use Case: "Show active items (pending + done)"
- See items that were completed
- See items that still need decisions
- Hide items that were missed/cancelled
```

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL CHANGES**

### **Files Modified (4)**

#### **1. API Route - Script** ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/coordinator/script/route.ts`

**New Logic:**
```typescript
if (showCompleted && hideMissed) {
  // Show completed + pending (exclude missed)
  schedQuery = schedQuery.or('completed_flag.is.null,completed_flag.eq.true');
} else if (showCompleted) {
  // Show everything (pending + missed + completed)
  // No filter needed - show all
} else if (hideMissed) {
  // Show only pending items (exclude missed and completed)
  schedQuery = schedQuery.is('completed_flag', null);
} else {
  // Default: Show pending + missed (exclude completed)
  schedQuery = schedQuery.or('completed_flag.is.null,completed_flag.eq.false');
}
```

#### **2. API Route - To Do** ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/coordinator/todo/route.ts`

**Same logic as Script route** - Consistent filtering across both tabs.

#### **3. Script Tab Component** ✅
**File:** `src/components/coordinator/script-tab.tsx`

**Updated Optimistic Updates:**
```typescript
// If showing completed items, just update the value (never remove)
if (showCompleted) {
  return oldData.map(item => 
    item.id === row.id ? { ...item, completed_flag: newValue } : item
  );
}

// If hideMissed is active, remove when changed to non-null
if (hideMissed) {
  if (newValue !== null) {
    return oldData.filter(item => item.id !== row.id);
  } else {
    return oldData.map(item => 
      item.id === row.id ? { ...item, completed_flag: newValue } : item
    );
  }
}

// Default: remove when marked as redeemed
if (newValue === true) {
  return oldData.filter(item => item.id !== row.id);
} else {
  return oldData.map(item => 
    item.id === row.id ? { ...item, completed_flag: newValue } : item
  );
}
```

#### **4. To Do Tab Component** ✅
**File:** `src/components/coordinator/todo-tab.tsx`

**Same optimistic update logic as Script Tab** - Consistent behavior.

## 🎬 **USER WORKFLOW EXAMPLES**

### **Scenario 1: Processing New Schedule Items**

1. **Start:** Open Coordinator → Script tab
   - Default view shows Pending + Missed items
   
2. **Work Through List:**
   - Click Pending → Redeemed (item disappears from view)
   - Click Pending → Missed (item stays in view, turns red)
   
3. **Review Everything:**
   - Check "Show Completed" ☑️
   - Now see ALL items: Pending + Missed + Redeemed
   - Verify what was done

### **Scenario 2: Focus Mode**

1. **Check "Hide Missed"** ☑️
   - Only see Pending items (gray chips)
   - No distractions from missed items
   
2. **Process Each Item:**
   - Click Pending → Redeemed (disappears)
   - Click Pending → Missed (disappears)
   - List shrinks as you work

3. **Review All Work:**
   - Uncheck "Hide Missed"
   - Check "Show Completed" ☑️
   - See complete picture of all decisions made

### **Scenario 3: Audit/Report Mode**

1. **Check "Show Completed"** ☑️
   - See everything at once
   - No items hidden
   
2. **Analyze Patterns:**
   - Count redeemed items (green)
   - Count missed items (red)
   - Identify members who frequently miss appointments

## 📈 **BEFORE vs AFTER**

### **Before Fix (Wrong)**
```
User clicks "Show Completed"
Result: Only see Redeemed items
Problem: Can't see pending/missed work anymore!
```

### **After Fix (Correct)**
```
User clicks "Show Completed"
Result: See Pending + Missed + Redeemed
Benefit: Complete view while maintaining filter options
```

### **Show Completed Checked**
- [ ] Shows Pending items
- [ ] Shows Missed items
- [ ] Shows Redeemed items (ALL items visible)
- [ ] Click any status: Item stays in view, chip changes

### **Hide Missed Checked**
- [ ] Shows only Pending items
- [ ] Hides Missed items
- [ ] Hides Redeemed items
- [ ] Click Pending → anything: Item disappears
