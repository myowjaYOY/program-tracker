## 📋 **USE CASES**

### **Use Case 1: Avoiding Disappearing Items**
**Scenario:** Show Completed is unchecked, only seeing Pending items

**Before:** User clicks Pending → Item disappears (became Redeemed)  
**Now:** User hovers, sees "Double-click: → Missed", double-clicks instead

### **Use Case 2: Quick State Changes**
**Scenario:** Need to change Missed → Redeemed (member rescheduled)

**Before:** User clicks twice by trial and error  
**Now:** Tooltip shows "Double-click: → Redeemed", user knows what to do

### **Use Case 3: Learning the Interface**
**Scenario:** New user exploring the system

**Before:** Has to experiment to understand cycling  
**Now:** Tooltip teaches the full cycle immediately

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

**File Modified:**
- `src/lib/utils/schedule-status.ts` - Updated `getStatusTooltip()` function

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Show what happens with 1 click and 2 clicks
const nextStatus = getScheduleStatus(getNextStatus(completed_flag));
const nextNextStatus = getScheduleStatus(getNextStatus(getNextStatus(completed_flag)));

return `Click: → ${STATUS_CONFIG[nextStatus].label}\nDouble-click: → ${STATUS_CONFIG[nextNextStatus].label}`;
```

**Tooltip Format:**
- Line 1: `Click: → [Next State]`
