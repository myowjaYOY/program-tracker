-- Phase 1: Allow NULL for Schedule Status (Safe, Backward Compatible)
-- This migration allows NULL values but keeps DEFAULT as false
-- Old UI will continue working with false values
-- New UI will be able to work with both false and NULL values

-- Step 1: Allow NULL for item schedules
-- ========================================
-- Remove NOT NULL constraint, but keep DEFAULT as false
-- This is backward compatible - existing queries still work
ALTER TABLE member_program_item_schedule 
  ALTER COLUMN completed_flag DROP NOT NULL;

-- Keep DEFAULT as false (do not change yet)
-- New items will still be created as false until Phase 2

-- ========================================
-- Step 2: Allow NULL for task schedules
-- ========================================
ALTER TABLE member_program_items_task_schedule 
  ALTER COLUMN completed_flag DROP NOT NULL;

-- Keep DEFAULT as false (do not change yet)

-- ========================================
-- Verification

-- ========================================
-- NOTES
-- ========================================
-- This migration is SAFE to run on production with old UI
-- - Allows NULL but doesn't create any NULL values yet
-- - DEFAULT remains false
-- - All existing data unchanged
-- - Old UI queries continue working
-- 
-- After deploying new UI, run Phase 2 migration to:
-- - Change DEFAULT to NULL
-- - Backfill false â†’ NULL
